Of course oTree has a readymade chat widget described here: 
https://otree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multiplayer/chat.html

But you can use this if you want a chat box that is more easily customizable,
or if you want programmatic access to the chat messages. 

This app can also help you learn about live pages in general.
