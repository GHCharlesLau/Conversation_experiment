On the next page, <span style="color: red; font-weight:bold">you will be paired with a participant in this survey to form a team</span>.<br><br>

The task for your team is to brainstorm <span style="color: red; font-weight:bold">as many unique uses for a cardboard box as possible</span>. Each use must be distinct—no repetitions.<br><br>

You will be competing against other survey participants, with the current high score held by Alex’s team.<br><br>

Feel free to engage in multiple rounds of conversation until you're ready to surpass Alex's high score.<br><br>

Now, let's get started!<br><br>
