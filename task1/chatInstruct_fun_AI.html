<p>1. You will be paired with <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">a conversational AI named MyBot.</span></p>

<p>2. Your task is to work with MyBot to brainstorm as many unique and creative uses for a cardboard box as possible. Each idea must be distinctâ€”no repetitions. 
You and Mybot are a team, competing against other teams, with the current high score held by Alex's team.<br>

Your goal is to gently encourage Mybot to contribute ideas.<br>

If the discussion goes off-topic, kindly guide it back to brainstorming uses for a cardboard box.</P>

<p>3. It is recommended that the conversation consists of 5 to 15 rounds.</p>

<p>4. Always use a friendly tone.</p>

<p>5. Please reply in English.</p>
